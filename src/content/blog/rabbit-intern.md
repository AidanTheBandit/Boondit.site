Hello everyone!

I have some really fun news: Im now working at Rabbit as an engineering intern. This is how it got announced to the community:

> "Hi everyone! I have some fun news to share!
> Usually, we wouldn't share staffing announcements, but this one is relevant.
>
> After being highly impressed with his work and efforts over the last several months, we at rabbit are happy to introduce you to (or re-introduce you to) our newest intern, who has officially joined our engineering team to help with various projects.
>
> Please welcome @/.idan to the team! 🎉" - Simon

## <My funny history with Rabbit />

I saw the launch at CES and wanted one so badly. For Christmas my grandmother got me an R1 and I loved it. The problem was mine had "the rattle". After fighting with support for a month I joined the Discord hoping for better support. I ended up staying because the community was so fun and I still loved my R1. I wasnt mad that it was defective, I just wanted to enjoy it again.

After complaining to Simon a LOT I finally got my replacement. My first major R1 project was the shell swap, a custom modeled shell to replace the OEM one (and you can 3D print it).

## <Creations happened />

When creations released as part of OS2 (little web based apps) I fell in love with how much more functionality it added. I wanted to push the limits. I first tested the waters with R1-Walky, one of the first creations. Then I tried more using sockets to build some multiplayer stuff.

My first big break was R1-Anywhere, a way to use R1 as an OpenAI compliant API. When I published it, I got a message from Jesse, the CEO of Rabbit. He wanted a meeting. I cant go into specifics, but Rabbit wasnt mad at all and were very impressed. That was the first time the idea of an internship was thrown out there.

A month later I demoed a new POC called "intern plugin" which allowed RabbitOS Intern to make creations that had a working and hosted backend. That got me a meeting with Jesse and the founding engineer. A while after that I joined the alpha testing group, something I never thought would happen.

## <The offer />

After a few months of very exciting testing I got an internship offer from Jesse which made my whole week. Im still so excited to be here. Words cant describe how badly Ive wanted to work at Rabbit and I cant wait to contribute to something great.

## <First prod fix />

Also a few days ago I contributed my first edit to the prod codebase. Simon dropped this in the channel and I was grinning all day:

> "what up channel
> happy monday
> i have a small update to share that isn't worth a full announcement on it's own, but we'll include it next time we do an announcement
> 🥁  roll plz.....
> magic camera batch export on rabbithole is fixed!!!!
> previously this was broken for anyone that had a lot of magic camera photos, it's now working great, so if you wanted to export a bunch of magic cam pics, you now can
> thanks to @/.idan (Boondit) for this fix!!!" - Simon

Its wild how I went from someone complaining about my warranty taking months to now working for this company. Ive loved this journey and I am beyond excited to contribute to Rabbit and the future projects to come! Ill keep making creations, but now I can also help build features and fix bugs to make things better for everyone. Im so hyped to be here :D

## <Thanks />

Thank you to everyone in the community who kept me around, tested my stuff, and pushed me to keep building. You all made this happen.
