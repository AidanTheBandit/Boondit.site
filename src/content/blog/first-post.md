# Hello everyone im Boondit...
Also known as Aidan.

I am a software developer. I mainly work in backend development using TypeScript and Java. I am also becoming more fluent in frotend developemt, as I learn how to better style websites using CSS and how to navigate the React framework.

I made this blog to serve as formal (goofy) place to share my different works, projects, and more with you all! I hope you enjoy my content. I will try my best to ensure posts are semi often and entertaining. 

## \<What im known for /\>
I am likely best known for my work on Barkle, a place for all to bark it out. 

Barkle is a social media platform that focuses on community building using Barks and Channels. Barks are what we call posts and channels are like dedicated communities for people to share topics and interests in. You dont have to post in a channel though because Barkle also a main timeline where people can share (almost) anything!

I am also known for Avunite, the company that owns Barkle, aswell as devlops Ai technologies. Avunite is "The Social Company". We devlop social experiances that conntect people together. We also work on Ai technologies, and are working to build more user orented Ai that's more helpful in day to day life aswell as have much more personality.

## \<What else do I do /\>
Aside from developing software and working on my business, I spend a lot of time with my lovely girlfriend, Nary. I am also learning new skills like how to build things in the real life. I am constantly trying to learn and devlop new skills since I find them interesting, and they make me more useful. Some things specifacly that im learning are how to build and develop hardware devices. I have been building small robots using Arduino. This has been very valuable as it teaches me electrical engineering and how to code in lower level langueges like C++. I am also learning how to construct sets as part of a theatre build team. This has taught me how to use tools like impact drills, miter saws, nail guns, and more.

## \<Closing remarks /\>
I hope you enjoyed my first blog post. There will be way more to come soon. This is all I have to say for now.

Thank you for reading,
Boondit (Aidan)
