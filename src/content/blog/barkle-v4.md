Hello Everyone!

I havn't posted in a while. Im sorry! Today I wanted to talk about,
## \<Barkle V4 /\>

Barkle V4 has been the culmination of months of work to bring back Barkle after a notice through Apple's developer portal from the government saying that we required further screening. However after calling Apple developer support line and speaking to the manager, he informed us that, that message is being displayed because the governemt for one reason or another deiced to flag Barkle. As a safety procaution we decided to make the imediate decision to temporarily shut down Barkle so that we can register Avunite (at the time BanditCo) as an LLC. During this time Barkle will be heavily upgraded to make the wait worth it to our users who had just lost one of their favorite platforms.

## \<So what happened /\>
After an investigation here is what we have concluded:
During the time the notice showed up, the US government was banning TikTok. Because of this we believe social media apps in general was being heavily monitored for any other Chinese owned platform, with Barkle getting accidently ropped into it all. Barkle is made in the US and is owned by the US based company, Avunite LLC which is 100% owned by its Founder and CEO, Aidan (me) who is a US born citizen. Not sure where they got China from within that see of red, white, blue, and bald eagles, but I digrace.

## \<Why make an LLC /\>
The decision was made to register Avunite as an LLC, because it gives Avunite the legal protections required to fight anything like this if it were to happen again in the future. Even though we don't make enough to require registration as of right now, we still feel these added protections will be benificial as social media platforms are generally higher risk than other software products it seems.

## \<What does Barkle V4 do /\>
Barkle V4 adds many features. Below is what we have finished and plan on getting done before/after the release of Barkle (depending on what comes first):

- Gift Barkle+ or Mini+
- Better algorithm
- OAuth 2 (allows websites to add login with Barkle)
- Profile activities (in the works)
- Barkle ads
- Improved DMs
- DM encryption (in the works)
- Better Barkle Live
- Better Barkle Live chat (in the works)
- Quick barks (in the works)
- Fixed embeds

## \<Hope you enjoyed /\>
Anyways thats it for this blog post! I hope you enjoyed it! I will try to write more posts in the future! Take care! Cya!
