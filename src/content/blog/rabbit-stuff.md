Hello everyone!

Ive been messing around with the Rabbit R1 a ton, so I wanted to put all my Rabbit stuff in one place. Some of these are creations, some are tools, some are just experiments that got out of hand.

## <The Rabbit pile />

- R1-Anywhere: a web app that runs on the R1 and lets you do remote control / API stuff. https://r1a.boondit.site
- r1-create: the unofficial JS/TS SDK for building R1 plugins with hardware access, AI, and UI helpers. https://www.npmjs.com/package/r1-create
- R1-Create.JS: the GitHub repo for the SDK. https://github.com/AidanTheBandit/R1-create.js
- R1-Walky: a walkie talkie app for R1 using WebRTC. https://github.com/AidanTheBandit/R1-Walky
- Rabbit Raycast: doom-like 3D engine on R1. https://github.com/AidanTheBandit/Rabbit-Raycast
- R1 Creations Gen: QR generator for R1 creations. https://boondit.site/r1-generator
- OpenClaw QR Gen: QR generator for OpenClaw gateway config on R1. https://boondit.site/r1-moltbot-qr
- Boondit Creation Store: a store and showcase for R1 creations. https://creations.boondit.site

## <Why I keep doing this />

Rabbit hardware is a lot of fun and I think this device/company have a blazingly bright future if the proper tooling is devloped. Its tiny, its opinionated, and it makes you build differently. I like that. Also the community is super creative and I wanted to give people tools that make building on R1 less painful.

## <Whats next />

More SDK updates, more tools, and probably more experiments. If you have ideas or want help making something for R1, hit me up.

## <Thats it />

Thanks for reading. Hope this helped catch you up.
