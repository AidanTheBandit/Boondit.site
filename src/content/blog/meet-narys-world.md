Hello everyone!

I made a new website for my girlfriend Nary as an anniversary gift: https://narys.world/

I made this website to be inspired by the 90s internet. While making the website I was thinking about how much fun Nary and I had on SpaceHay developing and customizing our profiles with CSS.

## <The design />

The site is intentionally loud:

- Big glowing headers and marquee text
- Blinking bits, borders, and old-school buttons
- A leopard-ish patterned background
- A warm palette (black, brown, gold, and tan)
- Comic Sans for the main vibe and Times for body text

It feels like a Geocities page, but still clean enough to browse on modern devices.

## <Why I built it />

Nary is my favorite person ever and I wanted to make something personal that would make her smile every time she opened it. It has her own blog, a guestbook, a visitor counter, and little things like a Barkle timeline embed and mini games.

## <Behind the scenes />

If you are curious, the code is here: https://github.com/AidanTheBandit/narys.world.git

It is built with Astro and styled by hand to keep the retro vibe consistent across every page.

I am now teaching Nary how to update and use her website. It should be exciting to see what she does with it!

## <Thats it />

Nary: I hope you like this. I love you so so so much! You mean so much to me <3
